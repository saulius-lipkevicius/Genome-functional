#  Racial pollution
This study purpose is to verify if PM2.5 pollution is racially biased and if we can predict counties black population ratio
based on pollutant PM2.5 daily concentration data, next aim is to confirm the increasing pollution as consequence of Trump
administration laws recalling. Study consists of 2016 year data from thirty PM2.5 pollutant monitoring stations from Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama states. PCA was applied to investigate overall variability, BD depth and time-warping plus
registration calculation to distinguish outliers in the data set and it was found out that Cameron and Nueces (Texas counties)
behave differently from whole data. At the ending functional scalar response linear regression fit is checked and showed
decent results, in consequence there is a log-relation between counties PM2.5 pollution and size of black community there.
Finally 2016, 2019, 2020 are compared with ANOVA test using multiple test statistics and most of them helps us to reject null
hypothesis of the same means, hence pollution mean is varying from year to year and Trump administration laws rollback
might have a impact(further analysis can be applied).


#  Genome effectiveness
Genome data analysis was performed using the same techniques as pollution investigation, only few more methods related to acceleration and speed were considered to calculate kinetic energy and etc
